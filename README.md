# Ritual Node Setup

Welcome to the Ritual Node Setup repository! This script helps you set up and manage a Ritual Node with options for on-chain, off-chain tasks, payment handling(still working on it not completed), and node monitoring.

I have used https://docs.ritual.net/infernet/node/introduction to code my script.
